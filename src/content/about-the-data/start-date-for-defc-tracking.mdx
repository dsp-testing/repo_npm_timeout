Disaster Emergency Fund Codes (DEFC) tag spending that are funded by supplemental appropriations laws, tracked in agency financial systems, and submitted to USAspending.gov in Files B and C on a monthly basis. These laws could have funded new prime awards (with no prior transactions) or existing prime awards (with a history of transactions before the enactment of the law). File B covers agency account spending, and File C covers agency prime award spending (which is a subset of agency account spending).

 

COVID-19 response spending tagged with DEFC values was tracked by agencies starting in April 2020 and was required to be reported in Files B and C submissions starting in June 2020. Due to the timing of when <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Implementation-Guidance-for-Supplemental-Funding-Provided-in-Response.pdf">Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-20-21</a> went into effect, if any awards were issued in March 2020 that were funded by the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 (enacted 3/6/20) or the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (enacted 3/18/20), they would not be tagged with a DEFC in USAspending data. However, given the timing of those bills and the additional delays inherent in the warrants and awards processes, it is unlikely that a significant number of such awards, if any, were issued in March 2020.

 

Infrastructure investment spending (through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) is tracked using the same DEFC system used by COVID-19 response spending.

 

When searching for transaction-level award data (coming from Files D1 and D2) or for subaward-level data (coming from File F), you can filter based on DEFC values if there is a prime award unique key linking a record in File C with a record in Files D1, D2, or F. When showing transaction-level award data or subaward-level data that have been filtered by a DEFC value, USAspending.gov uses a date filter to prevent the display of award amounts that could not possibly have been funded by the law associated with the selected DEFC value. (In the case of DEFC values associated with multiple laws, the date filter uses the earliest date of enactment.)

 

For example, let’s say a prime award has a history of transactions and subawards starting in 2005. After the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in 2021 (signed on December 27, 2020), this prime award received additional funding. If you search for this award and select the filter for this law (DEFC value “U”), then the prime award transaction-level results and the subaward-level results that you see will only show records starting from December 27, 2020. However, there is no way of knowing whether any prime award transaction or subaward after this date used funding from this law—the transaction or subaward may have used funding that existed prior to this law. This inability to track DEFC-tagged spending at the transaction level and the subaward level is an important limitation of the data.

 

Note that File C shows obligation and outlay amounts for specific DEFC values, but these amounts are at the prime award summary level, and not at the prime award transaction level or subaward level. The date filter does not affect the DEFC-tagged amounts in File C. The benefit of the date filter in transaction-level and subaward-level results is to show recipient and location data (among other details) about awards that were funded by laws tagged by DEFC values; these details are available in Files D1 and D2 (for prime award transactions) and in File F (for subawards), but not in File C.
